The Credit card fraud detection problem includes modeling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be fraud. This model is then used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not. Enormous Data is processed every day and the model build must be fast enough to respond to the scam in time. 
Our objective here is to analyse the usage of credit cards over the years using machine learning algorithms and transaction data to  identify or predict the fraudulent transaction in order to prevent it.
